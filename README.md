SUMIT
=====

Welcome to SUMIT, a [Creative Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) micropublishing platform devoted to catalyzing collaborative initiatives between innovators, practitioners, and donors in the global development community. By opening up the conceptualization, implementation, evaluation, and iteration of novel approaches to global development, we aim to improve the way that we share knowledge, innovate programs, and discover solutions to the world's toughest challenges.

THEMATIC GROUPS
===============

SUMIT models its problem framework using the categorization scheme defined by the [Sustainable Development Solutions Network](www.unsdsn.org). There are 12 thematic groups, which we refer to as vertical problem domains:

* 3: Challenges of Social Inclusion: Gender, Inequalities, and Human Rights
* 4: Early Childhood Development, Education, and Transition to Work
* 5: Health for All
* 6: Deep Decarbonization Pathways
* 7: Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems
* 8: Forests, Oceans, Biodiversity, and Ecosystem Services
* 9: Sustainable Cities: Inclusive, Resilient, and Connected
* 10: Good Governance of Extractive and Land Resources
* 11: Global Governance and Norms for Sustainable Development
* 12: Redefining the Role of Business for Sustainable Development
